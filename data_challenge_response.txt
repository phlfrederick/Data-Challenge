a) Unfortunately, AOV is a metric that is not robust to outliers and upon examining the dataset I was able to identify a couple of shops,shop id 42 and 78 in particular, that
   were skewing the order amounts distribution in different ways. Shop 78 sells a single pair of shoes for as high as $25,000+ which led me to believe it's more likely a data entry 
   issue otherwise WOW! In the case of store 42, there is one particular customer, user_id=607 who is placing large bulk orders of 2000 pairs of shoes a price point of $352 per pair 
   so over $700,000. We need to determine a metric that will prove to be robust to outliers such as these.

b) A better metric to consider would be the median order value which is less sensitive to the aforementioned outliers and much more realistic of the typical order value across our shops.

c) the median order value for this dataset is $284.00
